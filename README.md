# cloth-simulation-2d
The simulation was coded in Python using the Pygame and NumPy libraries.  It models a piece of cloth with the mass-spring method, and the result looks like a cool 2.5D effect!

This project utilizes Python as the programming language, employing the Pygame library for graphical rendering and interaction, along with the NumPy library for efficient numerical computation and matrix operations. It adopts the classic mass-spring system to simulate cloth physics, accurately reproducing the softness and dynamic behavior of fabric by calculating mechanical interactions between particles. Although the physical computations are entirely 2D-based, the rendering incorporates clever lighting and perspective techniques to achieve a visually convincing 2.5D effect with depth. The simulation runs smoothly and delivers impressive, lifelike results.

本项目使用Python语言，结合Pygame库实现图形渲染与交互，并利用NumPy库进行高效的数值计算与矩阵运算。采用经典的质点弹簧模型对布料进行物理模拟，通过计算粒子间的力学关系，真实还原了布料的柔软性与动态效果。在渲染层面，虽然物理计算完全基于二维平面，但通过巧妙处理，最终呈现出具有立体感的2.5D视觉效果，模拟效果自然流畅。
